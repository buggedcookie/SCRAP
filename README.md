# SCRAP

Self-hosted Conversational Roleplay AI Platform

## Description

SCRAP is basically what you get when you throw together a bunch of scraps (see what I did there) and hope for the best. It is a self-hosted web interface for chatting with AI characters, mostly made for roleplay but you can use it for other stuff too if you want. It runs on your own machine and uses Ollama, Coqui XTTS, and a bunch of duct tape to keep everything working.

It is messy, probably has bugs, but somehow it mostly works most of the time. If you want something polished and perfect, this is not for you.
Works on my machine, if it does not work on yours, let me know!

The code will be available soon (or not) when I feel like cleaning the mess up, adding more configuration options, and removing the hardcoded crap. And uh, well, I don't know when I'll feel like uploading it, lmao. (I'll try when I have the time and patience, I still don't know exactly how Python works...)

## Warning

If you are feeling down or having a hard time, please do not try to use AI as your only support. Talk to real people, friends, family, and/or professionals. SCRAP (or any AI) is fun, but it is not made to replace real help. I know life can be tough, but **please**, **__PLEASE__** don't use any AI as your companion or friend. It will only isolate you further.
